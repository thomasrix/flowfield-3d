# flowfield 3D
### Trying to work with attractors in 3D.

Bundles with Parceljs.
The objective is to keep it as barebones as possible.

### Scripts:
```ruby
npm run dev
# Bundles to dev directory and starts watching for changes, 
# serving ./src/script/index.html via http://localhost:1234 from ./dev directory

```
